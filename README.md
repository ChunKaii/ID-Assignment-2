# Design Process

- We wanted users to have the best experience on our website with its easy navigation and simplicity
- We used fonts that are easy to read and made sentences sweet and short
- We made the homescreen display some of the banners and products using a carousel that may interest majority of the users
- We wanted to get users to have a fun time on the website so a spin the wheel game was added which gives users the chance at being able to win a voucher to be used on their next purchase
